        <p>I started lacrosse in 8th grade. I fell in love with the sport. I made varsity my junior year.
            <em>Unfortunately,</em> due to COVID-19, I did not have a season. Nor did I have one my senior year.

        <p>I tried out for the Wellesley Lacrosse team last week. I was feeling anxious because I felt like not playing
            for two years is severely too my disadvantage. However, I had a great try out and was recruited. This is almost
            like <em>dream come true</em>!
