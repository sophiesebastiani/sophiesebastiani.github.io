               An analysis of how the current (as of 2023) housing crisis facing the US stems from the highly racialized failure of the 1950's and 60's movement of urban renewal by all levels of government. Focused on urban areas the federal gov labeled as "slums", where the majority of residents were Black, the destruction of community and personal structures allowed for the construction of "affordable public housing projects", which were essentially segregated apartments that became neglected by their public housing authorities, ridden with crime and mostly torn down during the 1990's and into the 2000's. Today, the long political relationships with private business allow for the further chipping away at the funds and resources allocated to public housing in this country. Further, corrupt leaders like cop mayors like Eric Adams making decisions, and essentially militarized states like the NYPD ($11 BILLION budget for 2023), the LAPD ($119M), etc. are perpetuating a national war against homelessness in favor of supporting private business interests (ie protecting the property of rich ppl ughh).
              <br><br>Using appropriated footage, especially news clips, I attempt to weave a visual timeline of the historical inequities in the housing market and address the cause of the same pattern of crashes in the market or great displacements like the failure of urban renewal, although its obvious to say, we must have leaders who put the interests of their constituents over serving their own interests in financial gain.

            Creating context, a visual narrative, through the spatial or sequential organization of static and moving images is so fun for me; I enjoy crafting a scene or series of clips that are densely-packed with information or feature small details that force the viewer to really pay attention, really look at the work. In this case, the visual metaphors are pretty obvious and simple but I think this early work really illustrates my interest in storytelling through collage, both spatially and temporally.
            <br><br> I also have always loved the look of stop motion and it feels like an analog process (ie creating film stills) while being replicated by myself on a digital camera; it allows for creative manipulation between frames, which I tried to play with in messing with the time and sequence of movements. This assignment was all about movement paired with audio. I chose Japanese Breakfast's Posing in Bondage (2021) because all of the (what I like to call) *fluffiness* in the beat allowed for the rapid cuts necessitated by the many frames and its a song that I think really speaks to the basic need and desire for human companionship, a feeling I *tried* my best to replicate in less than 2 minutes üòÑ.
